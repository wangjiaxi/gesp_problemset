# Code Rollback Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for rolling back all code changes in the GESP miniprogram project to a previous state (yesterday or earlier). The rollback should restore the codebase to a stable, working state while preserving any essential configuration or data files that should not be reverted.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to rollback all code changes to yesterday's version or earlier, so that I can restore the project to a previous stable state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the rollback process is initiated THEN the system SHALL identify all files that were modified today
2. WHEN files are identified for rollback THEN the system SHALL restore them to their previous state from yesterday or earlier
3. WHEN the rollback is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that all modified files have been successfully reverted
4. WHEN the rollback process encounters any errors THEN the system SHALL log the errors and continue with other files
5. WHEN the rollback is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of all changes that were reverted

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve essential project files during rollback, so that important configuration and data are not lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing rollback THEN the system SHALL preserve the original project structure and essential files
2. WHEN rollback is performed THEN the system SHALL NOT revert files that are critical to project functionality (like package.json, project.config.json)
3. WHEN rollback encounters configuration files THEN the system SHALL evaluate whether they should be preserved or reverted based on their importance
4. WHEN data files exist THEN the system SHALL preserve user data and only revert code-related changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a backup before rollback, so that I can recover recent changes if needed later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rollback is initiated THEN the system SHALL create a backup of all current files before making changes
2. WHEN backup is created THEN the system SHALL timestamp the backup with current date and time
3. WHEN backup is complete THEN the system SHALL store it in a designated backup directory
4. WHEN rollback fails THEN the system SHALL be able to restore from the backup
5. WHEN backup creation fails THEN the system SHALL abort the rollback process and notify the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a detailed log of rollback operations, so that I can understand what changes were made.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rollback process starts THEN the system SHALL create a detailed log file
2. WHEN each file is processed THEN the system SHALL log the file path and action taken
3. WHEN rollback encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log error details with timestamps
4. WHEN rollback is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of all operations
5. WHEN log file is created THEN the system SHALL make it easily accessible to the developer

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to selectively rollback specific components or directories, so that I can have fine-grained control over what gets reverted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rollback options are provided THEN the system SHALL allow selection of specific directories or file types
2. WHEN selective rollback is chosen THEN the system SHALL only process files matching the selection criteria
3. WHEN component-specific rollback is requested THEN the system SHALL identify and revert only files related to that component
4. WHEN selective rollback is complete THEN the system SHALL report which files were included and excluded
5. WHEN no selection is made THEN the system SHALL default to rolling back all modified files
